House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques

The project is focused on predicting house prices utilizing advanced machine learning techniques. This is Kaggle Competition challenge where a dataset with 81 features was given to apply 
different regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. 
I have utilized my knowledge of feature engineering, data cleaning, data preprocessing, training regression models 
and performance evaluation with MAE, MSE, EMSE and R-Square metrics. The final results shows that Random Forest is the best model because of
its capacity to manage complex relationship having higher R-square and less errors.
